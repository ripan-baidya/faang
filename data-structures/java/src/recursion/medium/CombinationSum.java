 * Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique
 * combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations  in
 * any order. The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations
 * are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different. The test cases are
 * generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations
 * for the given input.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
 * Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
 * Explanation:
 * 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
 * 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
 * These are the only two combinations.

     * Approach: Backtracking
     * The idea is to explore all possible combinations of candidates array. At each step, we have two choices:
     *  1. Pick the current element and move forward.
     *  2. Skip (donâ€™t pick) the current element and move forward.
     *
     * We stop the recursion when we either reach the length of the candidates array or the current sum exceeds
     * the target. If we find a valid combination (where the sum of the elements in the combination is equal to
     * the target), we add it to the 'ans' list. We use backtracking to remove the last element from the 'path'
     * and explore other possibilities when we exceed the target or reach the end of the candidates array.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(2 t/m)
     * Space Complexity: O(t/m), where t is the target and m is the minimum value in the candidates array.
