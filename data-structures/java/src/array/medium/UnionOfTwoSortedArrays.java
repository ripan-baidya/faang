 *
 * Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[], where each array may contain duplicate elements , the task is to return the elements in the union of the two arrays in sorted order.
 * Union of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements that are present in either of the arrays.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], b[] = [3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3]
 * Explanation: Union set of both the arrays will be 1, 2 and 3.
