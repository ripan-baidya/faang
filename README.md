## Data Structues and Algorithms

If you're preparing for **DSA or technical interview rounds at big tech companies (FAANG, etc.)**, this repository can be a great resource to **boost your preparation**.

It contains a well-organized collection of **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving practice code** that I’ve implemented during my preparation journey.

### What You’ll Find Here

* Implementations of **classic DSA problems**
* **In-depth explanations** for each algorithm
* **Popular SDE Sheets** (Striver, Love Babbar, Amazon, etc.)
* **Notes and patterns** for quick revision
* **Multi-language support** — Java, C++, and Python


### Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Java / C++ / Python
* **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
